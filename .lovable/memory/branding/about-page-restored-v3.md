# Memory: branding/about-page-restored-v3
Updated: now

The 'About MomoChao' (關於默默超) page is a local route (/about) featuring a luxury black and gold aesthetic. It consolidates the narratives for MomoChao and Rainbow Sanctuary, detailing the 'Mirror, not Script' philosophy and the four-dimensional thinking system (emotion, action, mindset, values). The page utilizes cinematic animations, including parallax scrolling and staggered entrance effects (via framer-motion), to reinforce the premium brand experience. All internal navigation for 'About' points to this local route.
