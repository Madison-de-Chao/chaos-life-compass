# Memory: branding/about-page-animation-standards
Updated: now

The 'About MomoChao' (關於默默超) page (/about) features enhanced cinematic animations, including parallax scrolling and entrance effects implemented with framer-motion's useScroll and useTransform. The layout uses container and item variants for staggered fade-in animations across sections, reinforcing the luxury brand experience. All TypeScript types are strictly defined to ensure stable animation performance.
