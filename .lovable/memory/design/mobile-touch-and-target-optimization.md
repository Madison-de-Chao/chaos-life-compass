# Memory: design/mobile-touch-and-target-optimization
Updated: now

Mobile user experience is optimized for touch with a minimum target area of 44-48px for all interactive elements, including navigation, buttons, and form controls. SelfCheckQuiz and LifeCompassForm feature specific mobile enhancements: active:scale-95 feedback animations, touch-manipulation responsiveness, and responsive grid/stacking layouts. Desktop-specific hover effects are suppressed on touch devices to ensure clean mobile interaction.
